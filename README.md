# EmilyLilyWebApi

This is a .NET web API to retrieve data from an Azure table storage and handle a contact form submissions for a Blazor web assembly front end project (Emily Lily Creations Website).

I intitially only created this API (about 6 months ago) to access Azure table storage, for displaying information my a static website (Blazor web assembly). However I have recently added a new controller to handle messages from a 'Contact' page.
